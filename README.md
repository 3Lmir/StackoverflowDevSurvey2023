# StackoverflowDevSurvey2023

This repository contains the analysis of developer survey data to explore the relationships between programming languages, database environments, cloud platforms, and developer compensation. The analysis addresses the following questions:

1: What are the common combinations of programming languages, database environments, and cloud platforms that developers use together in their development work?

2: Which programming languages are the most popular among developers who have been coding for more than 5 years, have development experience past year, and are interested in continuing to work with those languages in the next year?

3: Do developers who work with more programming language earn more?

4: Can we predict a developer's annual compensation based on their preferred programming languages , years of professional coding experience, and the size of the organization they work for?

## Summary and Results

The analysis revealed common combinations of programming languages, databases, and cloud platforms used in 2023. It also highlighted the top 10 programming languages preferred by developers. Surprisingly, the number of languages a developer knows did not significantly impact their compensation, while the geographical location played a pivotal role. Furthermore, the analysis found that education level had minimal influence on developers' earnings. Additionally, it explored factors such as programming proficiency, years of coding experience, and organization size in relation to compensation.
